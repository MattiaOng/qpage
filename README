I have just released this new and improoved versione of Qpage. It is probably one of the lightest CMS on the market. Althought very easy to use, its interface is very complete and versatile.
Now it has also a feed RSS and many other new features.
Server-side it is completely written in PHP. From a database point of view, it needs MySQL running.
Qpage generates clean HTML or XML pages -feed RSS; sometimes there's a minimal use of JavaScript.
